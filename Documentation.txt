Description :
Steganography : The Practice of hiding information within other data, such as images, audio, or text, to conceal messages,
                This project Based on Image Steganography (.bmp)
                Hiding messages inside image files by altering pixel values.
                The Least Significant Bit (LSB) method is the most common, where the smallest pixel value changes encode data without noticeable visual differences.
Proud to share my recent project on steganography, implemented in C programming, which allows encoding and decoding of hidden messages within images! 🖼️🔐
✅ Project Overview:
Developed a C-based steganography tool that securely hides text data inside images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding. The project ensures that data remains undetectable while preserving image quality.

🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used:
🔹 C Programming (File handling, Bitwise operations)
🔹 LSB Encoding & Decoding
🔹 BMP Image Processing
🔹 Custom Encryption for Extra Security

💡 Applications:
✔️ Secure communication 📩
✔️ Watermarking for copyright protection 🛡️
✔️ Covert data transmission 🔏

Would love to connect with cybersecurity enthusiasts and C developers to discuss innovations in secure data transmission. Let’s explore the world of steganography! 🚀

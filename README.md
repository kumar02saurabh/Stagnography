Proud to share my recent project on steganography, implemented in C programming, which allows encoding and decoding of hidden messages within images! 🖼️🔐
✅ Project Overview:
Developed a C-based steganography tool that securely hides text data inside images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding. The project ensures that data remains undetectable while preserving image quality.

🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used:
🔹 C Programming (File handling, Bitwise operations)
🔹 LSB Encoding & Decoding
🔹 BMP Image Processing
🔹 Custom Encryption for Extra Security

💡 Applications:
✔️ Secure communication 📩
✔️ Watermarking for copyright protection 🛡️
✔️ Covert data transmission 🔏

Would love to connect with cybersecurity enthusiasts and C developers to discuss innovations in secure data transmission. Let’s explore the world of steganography! 🚀
